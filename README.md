Data Analysis
Based on "Latitude vs. Temperature " scatter plot we can see that teamprature near the equater is high and decreases as we move the further away from the equater.this is because the equator is closest to the sun.

Based on "Northern Hemisphere Latitude vs Cloudiness" liner regression line we can see that Cloudiness increases as latitude increases.as we move futher away from the equator there will be less sun which might result into more cloud.

Based on "Northern Hemisphere Latitude vs Wind Speed" liner regression line we can see that wind speed increaes as latitude increases.since at equator the teapmrature is high so the pressure will be high and we move away from the equator pressure will be low so it will be windy beacuse of movement of air from high pressure to low pressure zone.

There are two jupyter notebooks VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb in WeatherPy directory.
In output_data directory all the images and the screen shots are saved, I have also saved 3 images in images directory for VacationPy.
